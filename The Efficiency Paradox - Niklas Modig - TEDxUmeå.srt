1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,630 
I believe that

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,610 
incorrect

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,930 
you over what true a fish

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:15,090 
it is during my life many times I

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,930 
had I want to be more efficient and I've
taken different actions and I've taken

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,670 
different decisions trying to be more
efficient but if I view my life

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,880 
I think that many of those decisions and
actions have been really

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,820 
counterproductive and I can see similar
patterns in the world companies

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,340 
organizations individuals or even
countries we view efficient see in a way

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,660 
which I believe can be extremely country
productive

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,800 
even if we feel or we believe that we
are becoming more efficient

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,160 
we are in fact decreasing efficiency and
i'll try to explain why

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,850 
imagine that this cute little guy was
your son

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,840 
let's call me mean he's 10 years old
he's full of energy

15
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,190 
he has a lot of different interests is a
popular guy he have different hobbies

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,190 
and their facility little crazy one

17
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,119 
he's your son then one day you get the
phone call from his teacher saying we

18
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,950 
are worried about the Miller we can see
that he has severe concentration

19
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,560 
problems and he cannot really
participate in the regular class he

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,640 
asked concentration problems and we have
been discussing this and we have a

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,130 
hypothesis that he might have ADHD ADHD
what is that

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,640 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
that means that a person have difficult

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:02,429 
to focus here she's impulsive and has
full of hyper-energy that's ADHD

24
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:07,140 
can you imagine if you got that message
how would you react react as a parent

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,190 
maybe you would agree that well let's
make an investigation because ADHD is

26
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,280 
considered to be a handicap

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,640 
so then working question what happens
when you do an ADHD investigation

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,430 
well there are seven different steps the
first step is that the parents

29
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,000 
they meet with the professionals and
discuss the situation after that step

30
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,400 
then you have a chat with the child and
get his or her perspective

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,189 
after that you do a functional I'm
investigation to see what is working

32
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:45,299 
what's not working

33
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:50,219 
after that you do a psychological
investigation and then after that you go

34
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,459 
to the medical investigation in the
cellar psychological investigation

35
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,120 
you see how they react if they cannot if
they can concentrate in the medical

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,930 
investigation

37
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,079 
you see how they react in different
medicines

38
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,519 
then you can compile all the information
from the different tests and you do a

39
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,099 
lot of different questionnaires and then
you can settle

40
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,129 
he has ADHD or not so it looks fairly
effective seven different steps

41
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,060 
the problem is this is not the case in
the real war

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,069 
it doesn't look like this fast sequence
of seven different steps rather it looks

43
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:23,849 
like this

44
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,650 
there's some green part where they in
fact do the investigation but there's a

45
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,010 
lot of red part as well where we wait

46
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,079 
because the way we organize Oregon
organizations and companies today is in

47
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,739 
two different islands different
functions where each function has one

48
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,180 
certain responsibilities

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,750 
so it's like taking a boat to different
islands that when you go to Thailand you

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,870 
travel to all these different islands
and that's exactly how an ADHD

51
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,979 
investigation look like and then one can
question if you are traveling to these

52
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,870 
seven different islands

53
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,099 
how long does it take well this is a
real example from the southern part of

54
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:03,720 
Sweden and it took in fact for months
and then one can question is that

55
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,650 
efficient

56
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:11,099 
what would you say if it was your kid
would it be efficient to wait for four

57
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,909 
months

58
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:17,970 
well if we look at this picture we can
compare the green part with a red part

59
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,039 
and then maybe we could have a
hypothesis

60
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,820 
maybe it's like twenty percent value
adding time and the rest

61
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,710 
eighty percent this is a non
value-adding time

62
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,509 
that's not the case the real case is
this

63
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,460 
if we come if we

64
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,819 
combine all 17 or the seven steps will
have 17 hours and contrast that to four

65
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:48,840 
months that is 2880 hours so that means
that our level of efficiency is

66
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,009 
zero-point-six percent during 99.4
percent

67
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,060 
we are out in the ocean and no one
really cares about us when we're up on

68
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,169 
an island then we get full attention
full attention of the doctors they're

69
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:02,130 
fantastic

70
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,819 
but when we are in the middle of two
different islands no one really takes

71
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:06,750 
carols

72
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:15,419 
the problem however is that we cannot
get this picture on a regular basis we

73
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:21,479 
don't see the big picture rather our
unit of analysis are only these

74
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:26,250 
different islands and we don't really
analyze them together we analyzed

75
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:26,909 
separately

76
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:31,169 
this is what it looks like from the
company or organizations perspective but

77
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:35,940 
the real problem if we take a customer
or patience or citizens perspective this

78
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,020 
is what it looks like

79
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,080 
ok email might have ADHD what is
happening then all of a sudden while

80
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,409 
it's the first step we have to go there
and use you go there and then is the

81
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,880 
next step all IE to chat with the kid
and then it's a functional investigation

82
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,669 
and then it's a psychological
investigation and then all of a sudden

83
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:59,669 
well I mean the medical investigation is
tomorrow but we don't have times we have

84
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,349 
to reschedule and reschedule

85
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,400 
and then the third time yes we needed
medical investigation and then we gather

86
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,240 
all information and then all of the
sudden we can settle this is the case

87
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,580 
but the problem is we don't see the big
picture because we are traveling to

88
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,479 
different islands & each island they
have like attempt over it when you

89
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,300 
inside there on the island then it's
fantastic to be there and one can

90
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,849 
question is this okay

91
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:31,800 
we can recognize this with health care
within companies and organization even

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,289 
in the integration process of new Suites

93
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,669 
we are developing organizations and
companies that are considered to be

94
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,539 
different islands & each island have
different responsibilities

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,710 
some years ago it was a fantastic man
his name is understood value

96
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,480 
he was working with ADHD investigations
at school and university hospital and he

97
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,310 
said this is not okay

98
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,350 
it's about our children we have to think
in a completely different way so he

99
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,520 
gathered all the personnel working on
the seven different islands is that we

100
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,190 
need to develop a new way of working

101
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,640 
so the question he said what is a good

102
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,920 
ADHD investigation everyone had to come
up with their perspective and they said

103
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,660 
well it's about seven steps seven
different step seven different islands

104
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,510 
and then he said but ok

105
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:29,660 
you have seven different step how can we
develop a way of working where we're

106
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,620 
working one team instead of seven
different teams one team where we really

107
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,980 
take a parent's perspective in a child's
perspective

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,180 
so we can deliver a good ADHD
investigation how can we do that where

109
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,590 
we have a common goal

110
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,730 
where we first deliver quality we want
to make a good investigation but we also

111
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,370 
want to deliver speed four months is not
ok we want to do it faster than the sat

112
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,650 
down and talked what is our best way of
working

113
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,390 
if we are going to work together seven
different steps and they could do

114
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,250 
decrease and decrease and decrease and
over time everyone could start to see

115
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,840 
the big picture

116
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,100 
everyone was not only an island they
said we are one island or one efficient

117
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,880 
ocean with different responsibilities
but we have the same goal

118
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,090 
so with visualization and continuous
meeting they could control the

119
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,560 
investigation process and in fact they
could do to decrease throughput I'm down

120
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,580 
to three weeks

121
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,920 
so four months down to three weeks and
then one can question how do you do that

122
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:38,690 
well it's fairly simple three weeks
instead of four months they had numerous

123
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,750 
positive effects on the organization

124
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,520 
first of all it was faster but then they
recognize it's so much easier to handle

125
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,240 
this

126
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:54,440 
why because we only have to take care of
five children at the same time

127
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,620 
when it takes three weeks when takes
four months we have to handle 35 cases

128
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,030 
at the same time think about if you're
at all haha if you were to answer your

129
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,530 
emails once a week

130
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,710 
how many unanswered emails would you
have in your computer if you were to

131
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,700 
answer two times a day you would have
much less little slower that's

132
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,500 
mathematical laws which can explain that
so if we go from four months down to

133
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,000 
three weeks we go from 35 cases down to
five cases then it was a very creative

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,870 
secretary said well if it's only five
kids let's take a picture of them we put

135
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,040 
them up on the wall and put the names on
them and then we meet in front of this

136
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,860 
wall every day so we can make sure that
we control control the progress

137
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,440 
this is what looked like this is just
effective picture that approximately

138
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:49,580 
five different kids and a standardized
process in three weeks three steps first

139
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,670 
week three steps second week and one
step

140
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:58,610 
the third week and what they did was
that they gather in front of this board

141
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,240 
everyone is that have we done step 1 yes
who were around step - yes

142
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,080 
have we done step 3 yes good we are on
track after first week and we don't step

143
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,820 
for us step 5 yes

144
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,360 
step 6 no we haven't gotten their
question area why

145
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,020 
and then they could put in extra
resources to handle that case

146
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:24,230 
so in order to be able to secure that
this in fact happened

147
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,090 
they can control the progress so that
perfect progress controlled by seeing

148
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,110 
the big picture

149
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,500 
so there are a lot of positive effects

150
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,620 
first of all it was some faster

151
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,640 
second of all they could increase and
have stable quality which in turn

152
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,670 
delivered a great experience for the
parents

153
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,670 
furthermore this reduce the stress of
the personnel and which in turn made the

154
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,890 
personal really really proud

155
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,230 
but the most interesting part here is
that it increased productivity more than

156
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:03,050 
a hundred percent and what I think is
interesting here is how is this possible

157
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,430 
we have a win win win win win win
situation everyone is better

158
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,880 
and if we look into micro economic
theory this is not possible we talk

159
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,990 
about trade-offs

160
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,890 
I mean we cannot deliver high quality at
the same time as low-cost it's

161
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,850 
impossible

162
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,990 
and so for instance if we have a five
star hotel then we can be good in high

163
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,120 
quality but we want delivering in terms
of low-cost or we have a budget hotel we

164
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,680 
are good in low-cost but we won't be
delivering high quality and there's we

165
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,730 
can have a five star force star three
trials top just the different type of

166
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,290 
all of customer needs

167
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,880 
but this case here we were beating the
trade of we were increasing quality at

168
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,630 
the same time as lowering the costs
increasing productivity and what I think

169
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:51,140 
is a really interesting is the question
how and that's why I want to talk about

170
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:58,399 
efficiency because if we look into
systems today we define efficiency from

171
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,570 
a resource perspective we define
efficiency from a functional perspective

172
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,339 
it's like we take an organization here's
the customer need and we kept the needs

173
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:10,970 
of the customer up and we say your this
is your responsibility this is your

174
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,010 
responsibility and this is your
responsibility

175
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,600 
and if I were the president I need KP is
to make sure that everyone delivers

176
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,040 
so we measure efficiency on an island
level with this is what we called

177
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,360 
resource efficiency

178
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,620 
so one can say that if this was a doctor
how much time available

179
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,029 
does the doctor have and how much value

180
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:35,060 
can she or he he deliver doing at that
time

181
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,570 
and this is what we call the resource
efficiency we try to measure of value

182
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,360 
from a certain function or a resource

183
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,560 
now the type of perspective that is to
put focus on the patient in this case

184
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,700 
it's like putting up a field camera
think if we had a GoPro and we could put

185
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,339 
it on email shoulder and press record

186
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:00,140 
once the need was identified until the
need was fulfilled then we would have a

187
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,800 
40 or four months long movie

188
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,360 
I would tell you that 44 months long
movie

189
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,649 
it wouldn't be an action movie we know
that there's only 0.6% that's a

190
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:19,149 
action imagine that you went to a cinema
sitting down waiting and it's only one

191
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:21,160 
minute after two hours that is action

192
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,279 
you would leave in a couple of minutes
because here we have competitive

193
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,410 
pressures we don't have that especially
not in the public sector we just have to

194
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,819 
wait

195
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:36,220 
so when it comes to phone efficiency
then we measure efficiency how well can

196
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,249 
we fulfill the need of a customer
totally friends so we have two forms of

197
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:47,079 
efficiencies either we drive have
resource efficiency making people work

198
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:52,179 
more utilize people's competence or we
drive low efficiency meaning that we

199
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:56,860 
feel the need our customers and of
course it's not about either or

200
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,300 
we want to reach the star but the
question is if we want to reach star

201
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:07,029 
which of these two forms how to
prioritize first we can compare them

202
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,410 
with each other web flow efficiency and
resource efficiency

203
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:15,309 
he resource efficiency we focus on the
resources

204
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:18,970 
the bad thing is that will have long
loop of time because all the islands our

205
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,540 
business so they will be accused of
waiting times in front of each Island

206
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,800 
the good thing is that we have high
capacity utilization efficiency

207
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,059 
here we have focus on the need

208
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:36,309 
instead we focus on how fast can we
fulfill the need but the bad thing is

209
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:41,980 
that we have low capacity utilization
which one of these forms

210
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,189 
shall we take low efficiency great from
a customer perspective resource

211
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:53,410 
efficiency great from the economies of
scale perspective but we research can

212
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,389 
see is that we shall always always
always drive so efficiency

213
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:04,870 
why I'll think about it what kind of
indirect effects with these two forms

214
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,939 
have on our organization

215
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,240 
if we fell over focus on resource
efficiency

216
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,399 
then we will develop efficient islands
where each Island do not see the big

217
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,149 
picture

218
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:19,689 
they only focus on what they are
supposed to be doing and after a while

219
00:15:19,689 --> 00:15:24,970 
they develop a subculture sub-culture
which after a while it get a king or

220
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,710 
queen saying this is my eye

221
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:32,020 
and don't come here and disturb our way
of working and when we have these kings

222
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,910 
and queens on the different islands

223
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,720 
what happens then well everyone are
doing a fantastic job

224
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,650 
but if you look from a customer
perspective how much of the total time

225
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,620 
do we really take care of the customer

226
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,490 
well we have a king or a queen taking
care of the customer during

227
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:54,250 
zero-point-six percent of the total time
during 99 perfect . four percent of the

228
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,380 
time in this case no one takes care
about the patient or the customer

229
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,830 
because they have done their part of the
work

230
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:09,070 
so if we drive resource efficiency we
will go to situation where we have 0 % %

231
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,300 
time where we care about the customer
but the indirect effects of low

232
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,370 
efficiency is that we go towards full
focus on customer satisfaction or

233
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,140 
customer focus and that's drives
effectiveness

234
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,310 
we're doing the right thing here drives
ineffectiveness we're doing the wrong

235
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,790 
thing because we're making decision from
an island perspective

236
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,770 
so what happens here what would you do
if it was your son

237
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,610 
email well you would probably sit there
and after a while when you feel that

238
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,920 
you've been waiting enough you will
start a call

239
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,330 
that's a new need because you're upset
and the doctor have to take care of you

240
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,700 
and I can promise you if it was your son

241
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,640 
you wouldn't be so nice to the doctors
is that have been waiting now for three

242
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,360 
weeks

243
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,110 
what is happening then you have to take
care of that

244
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:01,000 
so that's a new need so the organization
develops new needs when we don't focus

245
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,500 
on the flow and that's what we call the
efficiency paradox

246
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,459 
when we don't see the big picture we
will become ineffective

247
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,630 
we cannot see the big picture we make in
correct decisions we develop new needs

248
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,950 
and organization will become an engine
of waste and errors

249
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,250 
so if we look at this what happened
really

250
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,470 
with ADHD example well it took first
four months then they too good

251
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,510 
they could in decrease through time what
happens with a number of cases from 35

252
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,100 
down to five which is easier is just
want to handle 35 balls or five balls

253
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,350 
it's so much easier to handle but those
are the indirect effects that we do not

254
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,919 
measure when we measure island
efficiency because that can only be

255
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:46,419 
measured on a system level

256
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:50,799 
so number of cases decreases number of
handled it decreases number of restarts

257
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,799 
decrease its complexity decreases and so
much easier

258
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,059 
and that's the kind of situation we want
to be here

259
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:02,860 
we need to take care of things that do
not add any value at all but when we can

260
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:09,669 
have over capacity to always make sure
that we have efficient processes then we

261
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:13,929 
don't have delivered true value from a
systems perspective and from a customer

262
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:21,220 
perspective so prioritizing flow
efficiency drives effectiveness we do

263
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,330 
the right thing

264
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:33,820 
so my question to you is where do you
put up your camera on your employees or

265
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,960 
on your customers

266
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,580 
the city sense for your patience

267
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,580 
good luck

268
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,919 
yeah
