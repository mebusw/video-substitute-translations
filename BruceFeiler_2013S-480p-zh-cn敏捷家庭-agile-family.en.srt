2
0:0:12,000 --> 0:0:15,000
So here's the good news about families.

3
0:0:15,000 --> 0:0:18,000
The last 50 years have seen a revolution

4
0:0:18,000 --> 0:0:20,000
in what it means to be a family.

5
0:0:20,000 --> 0:0:22,000
We have blended families, adopted families,

6
0:0:22,000 --> 0:0:24,000
we have nuclear families living in separate houses

7
0:0:24,000 --> 0:0:27,000
and divorced families living in the same house.

8
0:0:27,000 --> 0:0:30,000
But through it all, the family has grown stronger.

9
0:0:30,000 --> 0:0:33,000
Eight in 10 say the family they have today

10
0:0:33,000 --> 0:0:37,000
is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.

11
0:0:37,000 --> 0:0:39,000
Now, here's the bad news.

12
0:0:39,000 --> 0:0:42,000
Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed

13
0:0:42,000 --> 0:0:44,000
by the chaos of family life.

14
0:0:44,000 --> 0:0:46,000
Every parent I know, myself included,

15
0:0:46,000 --> 0:0:49,000
feels like we're constantly playing defense.

16
0:0:49,000 --> 0:0:52,000
Just when our kids stop teething, they start having tantrums.

17
0:0:52,000 --> 0:0:54,000
Just when they stop needing our help taking a bath,

18
0:0:54,000 --> 0:0:57,000
they need our help dealing with cyberstalking or bullying.

19
0:0:57,000 --> 0:1:0,000
And here's the worst news of all.

20
0:1:0,000 --> 0:1:3,000
Our children sense we're out of control.

21
0:1:3,000 --> 0:1:6,000
Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute

22
0:1:6,000 --> 0:1:8,000
asked 1,000 children, "If you were granted

23
0:1:8,000 --> 0:1:11,000
one wish about your parents, what would it be?"

24
0:1:11,000 --> 0:1:14,000
The parents predicted the kids would say,

25
0:1:14,000 --> 0:1:17,000
spending more time with them.

26
0:1:17,000 --> 0:1:19,000
They were wrong. The kids' number one wish?

27
0:1:19,000 --> 0:1:24,000
That their parents be less tired and less stressed.

28
0:1:24,000 --> 0:1:26,000
So how can we change this dynamic?

29
0:1:26,000 --> 0:1:29,000
Are there concrete things we can do to reduce stress,

30
0:1:29,000 --> 0:1:31,000
draw our family closer,

31
0:1:31,000 --> 0:1:36,000
and generally prepare our children to enter the world?

32
0:1:36,000 --> 0:1:39,000
I spent the last few years trying to answer that question,

33
0:1:39,000 --> 0:1:42,000
traveling around, meeting families, talking to scholars,

34
0:1:42,000 --> 0:1:45,000
experts ranging from elite peace negotiators

35
0:1:45,000 --> 0:1:49,000
to Warren Buffett's bankers to the Green Berets.

36
0:1:49,000 --> 0:1:52,000
I was trying to figure out, what do happy families do right

37
0:1:52,000 --> 0:1:57,000
and what can I learn from them to make my family happier?

38
0:1:57,000 --> 0:1:59,000
I want to tell you about one family that I met,

39
0:1:59,000 --> 0:2:2,000
and why I think they offer clues.

40
0:2:2,000 --> 0:2:5,000
At 7 p.m. on a Sunday in Hidden Springs, Idaho,

41
0:2:5,000 --> 0:2:7,000
where the six members of the Starr family are sitting down

42
0:2:7,000 --> 0:2:10,000
to the highlight of their week: the family meeting.

43
0:2:10,000 --> 0:2:13,000
The Starrs are a regular American family

44
0:2:13,000 --> 0:2:15,000
with their share of regular American family problems.

45
0:2:15,000 --> 0:2:18,000
David is a software engineer. Eleanor takes care

46
0:2:18,000 --> 0:2:21,000
of their four children, ages 10 to 15.

47
0:2:21,000 --> 0:2:24,000
One of those kids tutors math on the far side of town.

48
0:2:24,000 --> 0:2:27,000
One has lacrosse on the near side of town.

49
0:2:27,000 --> 0:2:30,000
One has Asperger syndrome. One has ADHD.

50
0:2:30,000 --> 0:2:33,000
"We were living in complete chaos," Eleanor said.

51
0:2:33,000 --> 0:2:37,000
What the Starrs did next, though, was surprising.

52
0:2:37,000 --> 0:2:39,000
Instead of turning to friends or relatives,

53
0:2:39,000 --> 0:2:42,000
they looked to David's workplace.

54
0:2:42,000 --> 0:2:45,000
They turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development

55
0:2:45,000 --> 0:2:48,000
that was just spreading from manufacturers in Japan

56
0:2:48,000 --> 0:2:51,000
to startups in Silicon Valley.

57
0:2:51,000 --> 0:2:54,000
In agile, workers are organized into small groups

58
0:2:54,000 --> 0:2:57,000
and do things in very short spans of time.

59
0:2:57,000 --> 0:3:0,000
So instead of having executives issue grand proclamations,

60
0:3:0,000 --> 0:3:3,000
the team in effect manages itself.

61
0:3:3,000 --> 0:3:5,000
You have constant feedback. You have daily update sessions.

62
0:3:5,000 --> 0:3:9,000
You have weekly reviews. You're constantly changing.

63
0:3:9,000 --> 0:3:12,000
David said when they brought this system into their home,

64
0:3:12,000 --> 0:3:16,000
the family meetings in particular increased communication,

65
0:3:16,000 --> 0:3:18,000
decreased stress, and made everybody

66
0:3:18,000 --> 0:3:21,000
happier to be part of the family team.

67
0:3:21,000 --> 0:3:24,000
When my wife and I adopted these family meetings and other techniques

68
0:3:24,000 --> 0:3:28,000
into the lives of our then-five-year-old twin daughters,

69
0:3:28,000 --> 0:3:32,000
it was the biggest single change we made since our daughters were born.

70
0:3:32,000 --> 0:3:34,000
And these meetings had this effect

71
0:3:34,000 --> 0:3:36,000
while taking under 20 minutes.

72
0:3:36,000 --> 0:3:38,000
So what is Agile, and why can it help

73
0:3:38,000 --> 0:3:41,000
with something that seems so different, like families?

74
0:3:41,000 --> 0:3:44,000
In 1983, Jeff Sutherland was a technologist

75
0:3:44,000 --> 0:3:46,000
at a financial firm in New England.

76
0:3:46,000 --> 0:3:49,000
He was very frustrated with how software got designed.

77
0:3:49,000 --> 0:3:52,000
Companies followed the waterfall method, right,

78
0:3:52,000 --> 0:3:55,000
in which executives issued orders that slowly trickled down

79
0:3:55,000 --> 0:3:56,000
to programmers below,

80
0:3:56,000 --> 0:3:59,000
and no one had ever consulted the programmers.

81
0:3:59,000 --> 0:4:2,000
Eighty-three percent of projects failed.

82
0:4:2,000 --> 0:4:4,000
They were too bloated or too out of date

83
0:4:4,000 --> 0:4:7,000
by the time they were done.

84
0:4:7,000 --> 0:4:9,000
Sutherland wanted to create a system where

85
0:4:9,000 --> 0:4:13,000
ideas didn't just percolate down but could percolate up from the bottom

86
0:4:13,000 --> 0:4:16,000
and be adjusted in real time.

87
0:4:16,000 --> 0:4:19,000
He read 30 years of Harvard Business Review

88
0:4:19,000 --> 0:4:22,000
before stumbling upon an article in 1986

89
0:4:22,000 --> 0:4:25,000
called "The New New Product Development Game."

90
0:4:25,000 --> 0:4:27,000
It said that the pace of business was quickening --

91
0:4:27,000 --> 0:4:29,000
and by the way, this was in 1986 --

92
0:4:29,000 --> 0:4:33,000
and the most successful companies were flexible.

93
0:4:33,000 --> 0:4:35,000
It highlighted Toyota and Canon

94
0:4:35,000 --> 0:4:39,000
and likened their adaptable, tight-knit teams to rugby scrums.

95
0:4:39,000 --> 0:4:42,000
As Sutherland told me, we got to that article,

96
0:4:42,000 --> 0:4:44,000
and said, "That's it."

97
0:4:44,000 --> 0:4:46,000
In Sutherland's system, companies don't use

98
0:4:46,000 --> 0:4:49,000
large, massive projects that take two years.

99
0:4:49,000 --> 0:4:51,000
They do things in small chunks.

100
0:4:51,000 --> 0:4:53,000
Nothing takes longer than two weeks.

101
0:4:53,000 --> 0:4:55,000
So instead of saying, "You guys go off into that bunker

102
0:4:55,000 --> 0:4:58,000
and come back with a cell phone or a social network,"

103
0:4:58,000 --> 0:5:1,000
you say, "You go off and come up with one element,

104
0:5:1,000 --> 0:5:3,000
then bring it back. Let's talk about it. Let's adapt."

105
0:5:3,000 --> 0:5:7,000
You succeed or fail quickly.

106
0:5:7,000 --> 0:5:10,000
Today, agile is used in a hundred countries,

107
0:5:10,000 --> 0:5:13,000
and it's sweeping into management suites.

108
0:5:13,000 --> 0:5:15,000
Inevitably, people began taking some of these techniques

109
0:5:15,000 --> 0:5:18,000
and applying it to their families.

110
0:5:18,000 --> 0:5:20,000
You had blogs pop up, and some manuals were written.

111
0:5:20,000 --> 0:5:22,000
Even the Sutherlands told me that they had

112
0:5:22,000 --> 0:5:24,000
an Agile Thanksgiving,

113
0:5:24,000 --> 0:5:26,000
where you had one group of people working on the food,

114
0:5:26,000 --> 0:5:29,000
one setting the table, and one greeting visitors at the door.

115
0:5:29,000 --> 0:5:33,000
Sutherland said it was the best Thanksgiving ever.

116
0:5:33,000 --> 0:5:36,000
So let's take one problem that families face,

117
0:5:36,000 --> 0:5:39,000
crazy mornings, and talk about how agile can help.

118
0:5:39,000 --> 0:5:41,000
A key plank is accountability,

119
0:5:41,000 --> 0:5:43,000
so teams use information radiators,

120
0:5:43,000 --> 0:5:46,000
these large boards in which everybody is accountable.

121
0:5:46,000 --> 0:5:48,000
So the Starrs, in adapting this to their home,

122
0:5:48,000 --> 0:5:50,000
created a morning checklist

123
0:5:50,000 --> 0:5:54,000
in which each child is expected to tick off chores.

124
0:5:54,000 --> 0:5:56,000
So on the morning I visited, Eleanor came downstairs,

125
0:5:56,000 --> 0:5:59,000
poured herself a cup of coffee, sat in a reclining chair,

126
0:5:59,000 --> 0:6:0,000
and she sat there,

127
0:6:0,000 --> 0:6:3,000
kind of amiably talking to each of her children

128
0:6:3,000 --> 0:6:5,000
as one after the other they came downstairs,

129
0:6:5,000 --> 0:6:8,000
checked the list, made themselves breakfast,

130
0:6:8,000 --> 0:6:10,000
checked the list again, put the dishes in the dishwasher,

131
0:6:10,000 --> 0:6:13,000
rechecked the list, fed the pets or whatever chores they had,

132
0:6:13,000 --> 0:6:16,000
checked the list once more, gathered their belongings,

133
0:6:16,000 --> 0:6:18,000
and made their way to the bus.

134
0:6:18,000 --> 0:6:23,000
It was one of the most astonishing family dynamics I have ever seen.

135
0:6:23,000 --> 0:6:26,000
And when I strenuously objected this would never work in our house,

136
0:6:26,000 --> 0:6:28,000
our kids needed way too much monitoring,

137
0:6:28,000 --> 0:6:29,000
Eleanor looked at me.

138
0:6:29,000 --> 0:6:30,000
"That's what I thought," she said.

139
0:6:30,000 --> 0:6:33,000
"I told David, 'keep your work out of my kitchen.'

140
0:6:33,000 --> 0:6:34,000
But I was wrong."

141
0:6:34,000 --> 0:6:36,000
So I turned to David: "So why does it work?"

142
0:6:36,000 --> 0:6:39,000
He said, "You can't underestimate the power of doing this."

143
0:6:39,000 --> 0:6:41,000
And he made a checkmark.

144
0:6:41,000 --> 0:6:43,000
He said, "In the workplace, adults love it.

145
0:6:43,000 --> 0:6:45,000
With kids, it's heaven."

146
0:6:45,000 --> 0:6:48,000
The week we introduced a morning checklist into our house,

147
0:6:48,000 --> 0:6:52,000
it cut parental screaming in half. (Laughter)

148
0:6:52,000 --> 0:6:56,000
But the real change didn't come until we had these family meetings.

149
0:6:56,000 --> 0:6:59,000
So following the agile model, we ask three questions:

150
0:6:59,000 --> 0:7:1,000
What worked well in our family this week,

151
0:7:1,000 --> 0:7:5,000
what didn't work well, and what will we agree to work on in the week ahead?

152
0:7:5,000 --> 0:7:7,000
Everyone throws out suggestions

153
0:7:7,000 --> 0:7:9,000
and then we pick two to focus on.

154
0:7:9,000 --> 0:7:13,000
And suddenly the most amazing things started coming out of our daughters' mouths.

155
0:7:13,000 --> 0:7:15,000
What worked well this week?

156
0:7:15,000 --> 0:7:18,000
Getting over our fear of riding bikes. Making our beds.

157
0:7:18,000 --> 0:7:21,000
What didn't work well? Our math sheets,

158
0:7:21,000 --> 0:7:24,000
or greeting visitors at the door.

159
0:7:24,000 --> 0:7:28,000
Like a lot of parents, our kids are something like Bermuda Triangles.

160
0:7:28,000 --> 0:7:30,000
Like, thoughts and ideas go in, but none ever comes out,

161
0:7:30,000 --> 0:7:32,000
I mean at least not that are revealing.

162
0:7:32,000 --> 0:7:36,000
This gave us access suddenly to their innermost thoughts.

163
0:7:36,000 --> 0:7:37,000
But the most surprising part was when we turned to,

164
0:7:37,000 --> 0:7:40,000
what are we going to work on in the week ahead?

165
0:7:40,000 --> 0:7:42,000
You know, the key idea of agile is that

166
0:7:42,000 --> 0:7:44,000
teams essentially manage themselves,

167
0:7:44,000 --> 0:7:47,000
and it works in software and it turns out that it works with kids.

168
0:7:47,000 --> 0:7:49,000
Our kids love this process.

169
0:7:49,000 --> 0:7:51,000
So they would come up with all these ideas.

170
0:7:51,000 --> 0:7:53,000
You know, greet five visitors at the door this week,

171
0:7:53,000 --> 0:7:56,000
get an extra 10 minutes of reading before bed.

172
0:7:56,000 --> 0:7:58,000
Kick someone, lose desserts for a month.

173
0:7:58,000 --> 0:8:1,000
It turns out, by the way, our girls are little Stalins.

174
0:8:1,000 --> 0:8:4,000
We constantly have to kind of dial them back.

175
0:8:4,000 --> 0:8:6,000
Now look, naturally there's a gap between

176
0:8:6,000 --> 0:8:9,000
their kind of conduct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week,

177
0:8:9,000 --> 0:8:11,000
but the truth is it didn't really bother us.

178
0:8:11,000 --> 0:8:13,000
It felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables

179
0:8:13,000 --> 0:8:17,000
that wouldn't light up their world for many years to come.

180
0:8:17,000 --> 0:8:19,000
Three years later -- our girls are almost eight now --

181
0:8:19,000 --> 0:8:22,000
We're still holding these meetings.

182
0:8:22,000 --> 0:8:26,000
My wife counts them among her most treasured moments as a mom.

183
0:8:26,000 --> 0:8:29,000
So what did we learn?

184
0:8:29,000 --> 0:8:31,000
The word "agile" entered the lexicon in 2001

185
0:8:31,000 --> 0:8:33,000
when Jeff Sutherland and a group of designers

186
0:8:33,000 --> 0:8:38,000
met in Utah and wrote a 12-point Agile Manifesto.

187
0:8:38,000 --> 0:8:41,000
I think the time is right for an Agile Family Manifesto.

188
0:8:41,000 --> 0:8:44,000
I've taken some ideas from the Starrs and from many other families I met.

189
0:8:44,000 --> 0:8:47,000
I'm proposing three planks.

190
0:8:47,000 --> 0:8:51,000
Plank number one: Adapt all the time.

191
0:8:51,000 --> 0:8:53,000
When I became a parent, I figured, you know what?

192
0:8:53,000 --> 0:8:56,000
We'll set a few rules and we'll stick to them.

193
0:8:56,000 --> 0:8:59,000
That assumes, as parents, we can anticipate every problem that's going to arise.

194
0:8:59,000 --> 0:9:3,000
We can't. What's great about the agile system

195
0:9:3,000 --> 0:9:5,000
is you build in a system of change

196
0:9:5,000 --> 0:9:8,000
so that you can react to what's happening to you in real time.

197
0:9:8,000 --> 0:9:9,000
It's like they say in the Internet world:

198
0:9:9,000 --> 0:9:12,000
if you're doing the same thing today you were doing six months ago,

199
0:9:12,000 --> 0:9:14,000
you're doing the wrong thing.

200
0:9:14,000 --> 0:9:16,000
Parents can learn a lot from that.

201
0:9:16,000 --> 0:9:20,000
But to me, "adapt all the time" means something deeper, too.

202
0:9:20,000 --> 0:9:22,000
We have to break parents out of this straitjacket

203
0:9:22,000 --> 0:9:24,000
that the only ideas we can try at home

204
0:9:24,000 --> 0:9:28,000
are ones that come from shrinks or self-help gurus

205
0:9:28,000 --> 0:9:30,000
or other family experts.

206
0:9:30,000 --> 0:9:32,000
The truth is, their ideas are stale,

207
0:9:32,000 --> 0:9:35,000
whereas in all these other worlds there are these new ideas

208
0:9:35,000 --> 0:9:38,000
to make groups and teams work effectively.

209
0:9:38,000 --> 0:9:39,000
Let's just take a few examples.

210
0:9:39,000 --> 0:9:42,000
Let's take the biggest issue of all: family dinner.

211
0:9:42,000 --> 0:9:44,000
Everybody knows that having family dinner

212
0:9:44,000 --> 0:9:47,000
with your children is good for the kids.

213
0:9:47,000 --> 0:9:50,000
But for so many of us, it doesn't work in our lives.

214
0:9:50,000 --> 0:9:52,000
I met a celebrity chef in New Orleans who said,

215
0:9:52,000 --> 0:9:54,000
"No problem, I'll just time-shift family dinner.

216
0:9:54,000 --> 0:9:56,000
I'm not home, can't make family dinner?

217
0:9:56,000 --> 0:9:59,000
We'll have family breakfast. We'll meet for a bedtime snack.

218
0:9:59,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We'll make Sunday meals more important."

219
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:6,000
And the truth is, recent research backs him up.

220
0:10:6,000 --> 0:10:9,000
It turns out there's only 10 minutes of productive time

221
0:10:9,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in any family meal.

222
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The rest of it's taken up with "take your elbows off the table" and "pass the ketchup."

223
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You can take that 10 minutes and move it

224
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:20,000
to any part of the day and have the same benefit.

225
0:10:20,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So time-shift family dinner. That's adaptability.

226
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
An environmental psychologist told me,

227
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
"If you're sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface,

228
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:30,000
you'll be more rigid.

229
0:10:30,000 --> 0:10:34,000
If you're sitting on a cushioned chair, you'll be more open."

230
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:35,000
She told me, "When you're discipling your children,

231
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
sit in an upright chair with a cushioned surface.

232
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:40,000
The conversation will go better."

233
0:10:40,000 --> 0:10:44,000
My wife and I actually moved where we sit for difficult conversations

234
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
because I was sitting above in the power position.

235
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:50,000
So move where you sit. That's adaptability.

236
0:10:50,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The point is there are all these new ideas out there.

237
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We've got to hook them up with parents.

238
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So plank number one: Adapt all the time.

239
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Be flexible, be open-minded, let the best ideas win.

240
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:6,000
Plank number two: Empower your children.

241
0:11:6,000 --> 0:11:9,000
Our instinct as parents is to order our kids around.

242
0:11:9,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's easier, and frankly, we're usually right.

243
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
There's a reason that few systems have been more

244
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
waterfall over time than the family.

245
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But the single biggest lesson we learned

246
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
is to reverse the waterfall as much as possible.

247
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Enlist the children in their own upbringing.

248
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Just yesterday, we were having our family meeting,

249
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:30,000
and we had voted to work on overreacting.

250
0:11:30,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So we said, "Okay, give us a reward and give us a punishment. Okay?"

251
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So one of my daughters threw out, you get five minutes of overreacting time all week.

252
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:40,000
So we kind of liked that.

253
0:11:40,000 --> 0:11:42,000
But then her sister started working the system.

254
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
She said, "Do I get one five-minute overreaction

255
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or can I get 10 30-second overreactions?"

256
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I loved that. Spend the time however you want.

257
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Now give us a punishment. Okay.

258
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:58,000
If we get 15 minutes of overreaction time, that's the limit.

259
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Every minute above that, we have to do one pushup.

260
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So you see, this is working. Now look, this system isn't lax.

261
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:7,000
There's plenty of parental authority going on.

262
0:12:7,000 --> 0:12:10,000
But we're giving them practice becoming independent,

263
0:12:10,000 --> 0:12:13,000
which of course is our ultimate goal.

264
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Just as I was leaving to come here tonight,

265
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:17,000
one of my daughters started screaming.

266
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The other one said, "Overreaction! Overreaction!"

267
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and started counting, and within 10 seconds it had ended.

268
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
To me that is a certified agile miracle.

269
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

270
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And by the way, research backs this up too.

271
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Children who plan their own goals, set weekly schedules,

272
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:40,000
evaluate their own work build up their frontal cortex

273
0:12:40,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and take more control over their lives.

274
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The point is, we have to let our children succeed on their own terms,

275
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and yes, on occasion, fail on their own terms.

276
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I was talking to Warren Buffett's banker,

277
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and he was chiding me for not letting my children

278
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
make mistakes with their allowance.

279
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And I said, "But what if they drive into a ditch?"

280
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:1,000
He said, "It's much better to drive into a ditch

281
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:5,000
with a $6 allowance than a $60,000-a-year salary

282
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:7,000
or a $6 million inheritance."

283
0:13:7,000 --> 0:13:10,000
So the bottom line is, empower your children.

284
0:13:10,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Plank number three: Tell your story.

285
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Adaptability is fine, but we also need bedrock.

286
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Jim Collins, the author of "Good To Great,"

287
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
told me that successful human organizations of any kind

288
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
have two things in common:

289
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
they preserve the core, they stimulate progress.

290
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:30,000
So agile is great for stimulating progress,

291
0:13:30,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but I kept hearing time and again, you need to preserve the core.

292
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So how do you do that?

293
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Collins coached us on doing something

294
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that businesses do, which is define your mission

295
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and identify your core values.

296
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:47,000
So he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement.

297
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat.

298
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We had a pajama party.

299
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I made popcorn. Actually, I burned one, so I made two.

300
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:56,000
My wife bought a flip chart.

301
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And we had this great conversation, like, what's important to us?

302
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:0,000
What values do we most uphold?

303
0:14:0,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And we ended up with 10 statements.

304
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We are travelers, not tourists.

305
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:8,000
We don't like dilemmas. We like solutions.

306
0:14:8,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Again, research shows that parents should spend less time

307
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
worrying about what they do wrong

308
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and more time focusing on what they do right,

309
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:21,000
worry less about the bad times and build up the good times.

310
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
This family mission statement is a great way to identify

311
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
what it is that you do right.

312
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
A few weeks later, we got a call from the school.

313
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:30,000
One of our daughters had gotten into a spat.

314
0:14:30,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And suddenly we were worried, like, do we have a mean girl on our hands?

315
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And we didn't really know what to do,

316
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:35,000
so we called her into my office.

317
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The family mission statement was on the wall,

318
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:40,000
and my wife said, "So, anything up there seem to apply?"

319
0:14:40,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And she kind of looked down the list, and she said,

320
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
"Bring people together?"

321
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Suddenly we had a way into the conversation.

322
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Another great way to tell your story

323
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is to tell your children where they came from.

324
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Researchers at Emory gave children a simple

325
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
"what do you know" test.

326
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:0,000
Do you know where your grandparents were born?

327
0:15:0,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Do you know where your parents went to high school?

328
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Do you know anybody in your family

329
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:8,000
who had a difficult situation, an illness, and they overcame it?

330
0:15:8,000 --> 0:15:11,000
The children who scored highest on this "do you know" scale

331
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:16,000
had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives.

332
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
The "do you know" test was the single biggest predictor

333
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:22,000
of emotional health and happiness.

334
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
As the author of the study told me,

335
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:28,000
children who have a sense of -- they're part of a larger narrative

336
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
have greater self-confidence.

337
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So my final plank is, tell your story.

338
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Spend time retelling the story of your family's positive moments

339
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and how you overcame the negative ones.

340
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
If you give children this happy narrative,

341
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:49,000
you give them the tools to make themselves happier.

342
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:51,000
I was a teenager when I first read "Anna Karenina"

343
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and its famous opening sentence,

344
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:55,000
"All happy families are alike.

345
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

346
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:2,000
When I first read that, I thought, "That sentence is inane.

347
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Of course all happy families aren't alike."

348
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:8,000
But as I began working on this project,

349
0:16:8,000 --> 0:16:10,000
I began changing my mind.

350
0:16:10,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Recent scholarship has allowed us, for the first time,

351
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:16,000
to identify the building blocks

352
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
that successful families have.

353
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I've mentioned just three here today:

354
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Adapt all the time, empower the children, tell your story.

355
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:30,000
Is it possible, all these years later, to say Tolstoy was right?

356
0:16:30,000 --> 0:16:34,000
The answer, I believe, is yes.

357
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:37,000
When Leo Tolstoy was five years old,

358
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:38,000
his brother Nikolay came to him

359
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and said he had engraved the secret to universal happiness

360
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
on a little green stick, which he had hidden

361
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:47,000
in a ravine on the family's estate in Russia.

362
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:52,000
If the stick were ever found, all humankind would be happy.

363
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Tolstoy became consumed with that stick, but he never found it.

364
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:1,000
In fact, he asked to be buried in that ravine where he thought it was hidden.

365
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:6,000
He still lies there today, covered in a layer of green grass.

366
0:17:6,000 --> 0:17:8,000
That story perfectly captures for me

367
0:17:8,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the final lesson that I learned:

368
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Happiness is not something we find,

369
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
it's something we make.

370
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:20,000
Almost anybody who's looked at well-run organizations

371
0:17:20,000 --> 0:17:23,000
has come to pretty much the same conclusion.

372
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Greatness is not a matter of circumstance.

373
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
It's a matter of choice.

374
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:31,000
You don't need some grand plan. You don't need a waterfall.
